# Quantifying the non-reported new daily COVID-2019 cases by region in Spain 

#### Webpage: [underreported.github.io](https://underreported.github.io/)

<p align="justify"> The present outbreak of  COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has put the planet in quarantine. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern", and then a pandemic on March 11.</p>

<p align="justify"> Spain has become the fifth country worldwide with more infected cases, officially registering over 13 thousand cases in a short time. Although many critical and severe measures have been considered from the authorities to lessen the impact of the outbreak and help flatten the curve, they rely on numbers that could be unreliable and therefore misrepresent the implications of such pandemic. </p>

Counts in Spain due to the protocols used for testing, mainly include individuals with severe symptoms. The authorities have juste announced a new protocol with rapid tests to be implementend in a few days [elpais.com](https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-03-18/el-numero-de-personas-contagiadas-por-coronavirus-crece-hasta-las-13716-un-18-mas-que-hace-un-dia.html).

<p align="justify"> Given the nature of our data, we can guess that the estimated number of cases that we are finding are in fact potentially severe cases, and presumably the size of the infected population (asymptomatic) is even higher.</p>

The current analysis aims to update the situation concerning COVID-19 daily, and particularly quantify the potential under-reporting in the official registered cases by region in Spain. Results herein can help to have a more realistic picture of the pandemic at a real time as well as to more accurately estimate essential measures such as the basic reproduction number or the fatality rate that are used for practitioners and politicians to make decisions.</p>

The data for the analysis have been  extracted from [eldiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/Consulta-evolucion-coronavirus-expansion-Espana_0_1005099739.html#mapaccaa), where official data are gathered.

<p align="justify"> Notice that this analysis con be easily reproduced for other countries. </p>
